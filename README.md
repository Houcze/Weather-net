Improve the prediction results of the numerical model in a way independent of the numerical model. (This will use history data) and use deep learning to do data assimilation
The use of deep learning to complete data assimilation in meteorological science may be different from peopleâ€™s understanding of data assimilation, but the reanalysis data that has been formed in the experiment, were proved to be able express observations better, especially on some variables, in some cases, compared to NCEP's reanalysis data.

The project comes from  the Thesis of my bachelor's degree.
